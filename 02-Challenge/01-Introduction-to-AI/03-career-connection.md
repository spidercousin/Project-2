Welcome to your first Career Connection!

We, your career team, are excited to help you with your professional goals. Developing an effective career plan can be a complex process as you consider your professional goals, personal values, and the hiring market&mdash;and we don’t want you to face it alone. However, with the help of your career team, you will have the tools, resources, and knowledge needed to create your professional vision, expand your network, and achieve your desired goals.

At the end of each module, a Career Connection will review career topics and provide tips on how to move forward in your career. This first Career Connection provides an overview of everything available to you through career services.
