# Project 2 - GeoValuate: Optimizing Residential Real Estate PredictionS through Machine Learning Models

## Project Statement
The real estate market is characterized by pricing volatility influenced by economic conditions, market demand, and localized factors such as neighborhood desirability, school districts, and proximity to amenities. Additionally, geographical attributes like climate, urban density, and regional economic trends significantly impact property pricing and the time required to sell a home.

In response to these challenges, the objective of this project is to develop an AI-powered solution that leverages historical housing market data from the ATTOM API to predict housing prices based on information input by users such as desired real estate location and housing attributes. By training a machine learning model with extensive historical data, the project aims to provide buyers and sellers with actionable insights into optimal listing and offer prices. This solution will empower users to make informed decisions aligned with their selling or purchasing goals, enhancing transparency and efficiency in the housing market.

## SmartPrice Intelligence Navigator (SPIN)

The SmartPrice Intelligence Navigator (SPIN) is an AI-powered solution designed to revolutionize how buyers and sellers interact with the housing market. Combining advanced machine learning with rich historical data from the ATTOM API, SPIN predicts housing prices and market performance with exceptional accuracy. SPIN is an application designed to evaluate how various factors impact real estate pricing in patterns in different geographical locations. The application relies on historical housing sales data from [ATTOM](https://www.attomdata.com/), [RentCast](https://developers.rentcast.io/reference/value-estimate), [Zillow](https://www.zillowgroup.com/developers/api/zestimate/zestimates-api/), and historical geographical data from [Geoapify](https://www.geoapify.com/) and [Google Places](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview).

By evaluating factors like property features, neighborhood characteristics, and localized economic conditions, SPIN offers tailored guidance on listing and offer prices. It also accounts for broader influences such as seasonal trends and regional market dynamics, enabling users to respond strategically to market volatility.

SPINâ€™s intuitive design and insightful recommendations empower users to make data-driven decisions, whether they aim to sell at the highest possible price or buy a home that aligns with their budget and goals. Its focus on clarity and precision makes SPIN an essential navigator in the ever-changing real estate landscape.

## Programming Language and Technology
The Housing Prediction Analysis Tool is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) data interchange format.

Visualizations are provided through the use of [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Prophet](https://pypi.org/project/prophet/).

Real estate statistics and analysis information were retrieved from [ATTOM](https://www.attomdata.com/), [RentCast](https://developers.rentcast.io/reference/value-estimate), [Zillow](https://www.zillowgroup.com/developers/api/zestimate/zestimates-api/), and geographical information was retrieved from [Geoapify](https://www.geoapify.com/) and [Google Places](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview). 

The [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) libraries were used to work with the historical real estate and geographical data retrieved from [Geoapify](https://www.geoapify.com/) APIs.

## Installation Guide

The contents of the repository should be placed into the desired folder on the user's computer, being sure to maintain the directory structure. 

The application was developed using Python version 3.12.4. Other versions of Python may work, but no guarantee is made. We suggest using a new virtual environment with the correct version of Python.

The following Python packages must be installed to run the application locally:

* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Prophet
* Jupyterlab (only if the .ipynb file is used. running the .py file does not require Jupyterlab)

These packages may be individually installed into the environment of your choice. You will also need to obtain an API key for the ATTOM API and store it as ATTOM_API_Key in a file named local_keys.env. Alternatively, you may enter your ATTOM API key into the code manually, if desired. Additionally, you will need to obtain an API key from Geoapify and store it in your local_keys.env file as geo.

**Project Goals:** 
  1. Make a prediction model that will help determine the best pricing and the best time to buy or sell a home within any given market.
  2. Develop a user interface for the user to input information specific to the housing market they are interested in exploring.
  
**Impacts on Goal:**
  1. Geo-location
  2. Job Industry
  3. Crime Rates
  4. Interest Rate
  5. Property Taxes
  6. Schools
  7. Leisure Activities

## Initial Research Questions

Here are some initial research questions aligned with the project, including a focus on how various factors influence housing pricing and market dynamics:

**Impact of Location and Amenities:**

- How does proximity to schools, attractions, and public transportation impact housing prices?
What is the relationship between the quality of local schools and the average days a property stays on the market?
How do neighborhood characteristics, such as crime rates and walkability, influence listing and offer prices?

**Economic and Tax Impacts:**

- How do local property taxes and tax incentives affect housing pricing trends?
What role do regional economic factors, such as employment rates and average income levels, play in housing market dynamics?

**Temporal and Seasonal Trends:**

- How do seasonal trends and economic cycles influence housing prices and time on the market?
Are there specific months or quarters where homes are more likely to sell faster or at higher prices?

**Market Dynamics and Competition:**

- How do supply and demand imbalances (e.g., number of homes for sale versus buyers) affect pricing accuracy and days on the market?
What patterns emerge in bidding wars or underpriced listings and their effect on the market?

**Custom Attributes Analysis:**

- What specific real estate attributes (e.g., number of bedrooms, square footage, lot size) have the strongest predictive value for housing prices?
How do unique features such as energy-efficient systems or smart home technology impact pricing and marketability?

**Geographical Influences:**

- How do geographical attributes such as climate, coastal proximity, and urban versus rural settings influence pricing models?
Are there regional differences in housing price volatility, and how do these differences impact the predictability of selling prices and market durations?

These questions aim to guide the data exploration and model development process, ensuring the project addresses key factors influencing the real estate market.
