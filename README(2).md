# Project Housing Prediction Alpha - 2

(25 points) Data model implementation - Creat jupyter notebook for cleaning and transformation process
  1. How did we clean it and how did we train it
(35 points) Creating jupyter notebook that contains the data transformation process and converting it to a csv file.



Goal: 
  1. Make a prediction model that will help determine the best time to buy or sell a home within any given market.
  2. Develop a UI for the user to input information specific to the housing market they are interested in.

Impacts on Goal:
  1. Geo-location
  2. Job industry
  3. Crime rates
  4. Intrest rate
  5. Property taxes
  6. Schools
  7. Leisure activities

Project Road Map:
  1. Get APIs and information on all the "Impact on goals."
  2. Pull in APIs, clean and transform them into readable information for ML model.
  3. Write out step by step how step 2 was done in the remarks on the jupyter file.
  4. Export clean data in CSV to ML model.
  5. Run accuracy report on each model to determine which model should be used for the deliverable.
  6. Pick and optimize the best model for UI implementation.
  7. Prompt user to input information
      Area Code
      Schools
